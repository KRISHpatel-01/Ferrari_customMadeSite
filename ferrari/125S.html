	 first car to wear the Ferrari badge. 
	The V12 engine was designed by 
	Gioacchino Colombo with contributions 
	from Giuseppe Busso and Luigi Bazzi. 
	Sport and competition versions of the 
	125 S were built with different bodywork
	 although the chassis and running gear 
	of the cars remained basically identical.

	The 125 S’s debut on the Piacenza 
	circuit was, in the words of Enzo 
	Ferrari himself, “a promising failure.” 
	In fact, Franco Cortese had to pull out 
	because of a problem with the fuel pump 
	while leading the race. However, over 
	the following four months, the 125 S 
	was back on the track 13 times, winning 
	six of its races.
