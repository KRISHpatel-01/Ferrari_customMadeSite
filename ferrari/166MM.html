	Designed for long distance competition, 
	the 166 MM took its name from one of the
	 world’s most famous road races, the 
	Mille Miglia, in which the Maranello 
	cars were to triumph again and again. 
	Its coachwork was built by Touring using
	 the “Superlight” method. The 166 MM was
	 both extremely light and extremely 
	dynamic whilst still maintaining 
	significant structural stiffness. The 
	166 MM’s engine was also modified for 
	run on “normal” commercially available 
	fuel.
